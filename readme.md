This is a brief explaination of the changes made to the new files

I have created a new json file called rates.json in that files contains the link to all the files in the slides folder apart from the auto generated resources.
Any time you wish to create a new file within the slides folder, make sure include the json formart in the rate.json file then, it will pick the link and insert it into the default.json file

You can access the every media file via the normal url without the /horizontal.php

make sure your folder structure is C:/xampp/htdocs/ree-fidelity/

Just Import the media.02.sql file to delete the old database and recreate a new one which will contain all the required fields;
